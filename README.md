# GenAI
This project builds a GenAI-powered multi-agent support system where a Router Agent classifies user queries and routes them to Product, Technical, or Billing agents. Using API testing in Thunder Client, the system generates intelligent responses and handles POST/PUT/GET requests with real-time validation.
