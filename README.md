GenAI-Based Enterprise Support Agent Orchestrator

This project builds a GenAI-powered multi-agent support system where a Router Agent classifies user queries and routes them to Product, Technical, or Billing agents. Using API testing in Thunder Client, the system generates intelligent responses and handles POST/PUT/GET requests with real-time validation.

This project demonstrates a Generative AI–powered multi-agent orchestration system designed to streamline enterprise customer support for a SaaS-based organization. The architecture includes a Router Agent, Product Specialist Agent, Technical Support Agent, and Order/Billing Agent, all coordinated by a central GenAI Orchestrator. When a user submits a query through an API endpoint, the Router Agent intelligently classifies the request—such as product information, technical troubleshooting, or billing issues—and routes it to the appropriate specialized agent. Each agent uses Generative AI (LLMs) to retrieve, analyze, and produce contextual, human-like responses based on its domain knowledge.

Using VS Code’s Thunder Client, the system supports full API interaction, including POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET requests. This allows real-time testing of conversation flow, validation of input structures, and immediate visibility of system behavior. When users send a query, the server responds with detailed, natural-language answers generated by the relevant agent, while incorrect or malformed inputs may result in controlled API errors—demonstrating robust validation logic.

The screenshots highlight successful API responses, showing that the GenAI agents are capable of extracting insights, summarizing technical features, and generating structured support answers. The system showcases how GenAI can automate enterprise customer service, improve accuracy, and provide scalable intelligent support across diverse domains, all while maintaining conversation context and agent coordination through a centralized orchestration layer.
